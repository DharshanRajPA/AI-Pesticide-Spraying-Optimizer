4. **Check confidence scores** (approval required if <80%)
5. **Verify pest/disease identification** with field knowledge

### Step 3: Dose Optimization

1. **Review optimization results** from the system
2. **Check dose calculations** against pesticide labels
3. **Verify regulatory compliance** (total dose limits)
4. **Confirm safety margins** are maintained
5. **Approve or modify** the optimization plan

### Step 4: Flight Planning

1. **Review generated flight plan** on the map interface
2. **Check waypoint accuracy** and safety
3. **Verify spray timing** for each plant
4. **Confirm total flight time** is within battery limits
5. **Approve flight plan** for execution

## Flight Planning

### Mission Parameters
